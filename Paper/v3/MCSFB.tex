%\begin{abstract}
%We investigate an $M$-channel critically sampled filter bank for graph signals where each of the $M$ filters is supported on a different subband of the graph Laplacian spectrum. We partition the graph vertices such that the $m^{th}$ set comprises a uniqueness set for signals supported on the $m^{th}$ subband. For analysis, the graph signal is filtered on each subband and downsampled on the corresponding set of vertices. However, the classical synthesis filters are replaced with interpolation operators, circumventing the issue of how to design a downsampling pattern and graph spectral filters to ensure perfect reconstruction for signals that do not reside on bipartite graphs. The resulting transform is critically sampled and graph signals are perfectly reconstructable from their analysis coefficients. We empirically explore the joint vertex-frequency localization of the dictionary atoms and sparsity of the analysis coefficients, as well as the ability of the proposed transform to compress

\begin{abstract}
We investigate a scalable $M$-channel critically sampled filter bank for graph signals, where each of the $M$ filters is supported on a different subband of the graph Laplacian spectrum. For analysis, the graph signal is filtered on each subband and downsampled on a corresponding set of vertices. However, the classical synthesis filters are replaced with interpolation operators. For small graphs, we use a full eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian to partition the graph vertices such that the $m^{th}$ set comprises a uniqueness set for signals supported on the $m^{th}$ subband. The resulting transform is critically sampled, the dictionary atoms are orthogonal to those supported on different bands, and graph signals are perfectly reconstructable from their analysis coefficients. We also investigate fast versions of the proposed transform that scale efficiently for large, sparse graphs. Issues that arise in this context include designing the filter bank to be more amenable to polynomial approximation, estimating the number of samples required for each band, performing non-uniform random sampling for the filtered signals on each band, and using efficient reconstruction methods. We empirically explore the joint vertex-frequency localization of the dictionary atoms, the sparsity of the analysis coefficients for different classes of signals, the ability of the proposed transform to compress piecewise-smooth graph signals, and the reconstruction error resulting from the numerical approximations.

\section{Introduction}

In graph signal processing \cite{shuman2013emerging}, transforms and filter banks can help exploit structure in the data, in order, for example, to compress a graph signal, remove noise, or fill in missing information. 
Broad classes of recently proposed transforms include graph Fourier transforms, vertex domain designs such as \cite{Crovella2003,wang}, top-down approaches such as \cite{szlam,gavish,irion}, diffusion-based designs such as \cite{coifman2006diffusion,Maggioni_biorthogonal}, spectral domain designs such as \cite{hammond2011wavelets,shuman2013spectrum}, windowed graph Fourier transforms  \cite{shuman2015vertex}, and generalized filter banks, the last of which we focus on in this paper. For further introduction to dictionary designs for graph signals, see \cite{shuman2013emerging}.

\end{figure}


The extension of the classical two channel critically sampled filter bank to the graph setting was first proposed in \cite{narang_icip}. Fig.\ \ref{Fig:two_channel} shows the analysis and synthesis banks, where ${\bf H}_i$ and ${\bf G}_i$ are graph spectral filters \cite{shuman2013emerging}, and the lowpass and highpass bands are downsampled on complementary sets of vertices. For a general weighted, undirected graph, it is not straightforward %{\color{red} (impossible?)} 
how to design the downsampling and the four graph spectral filters to ensure perfect reconstruction. One approach is to separate the graph into a union of subgraphs, each of which has some regular structure. For example, \cite{narang2012perfect,narang_bior_filters} show that the normalized graph Laplacian eigenvectors of \emph{bipartite} graphs have a spectral folding property that make it possible to design analysis and synthesis filters to guarantee perfect reconstruction. They take advantage of this property by decomposing the graph into bipartite graphs and constructing a multichannel, separable filter bank, while \cite{sakiyama} adds vertices and edges to the original graph to form an approximating bipartite graph. References \cite{teke2016,teke2017ii} generalize this spectral folding property to $M$-block cyclic graphs, and leverage it to construct $M$-channel graph filter banks. Another class of regular structured graphs is \emph{shift invariant} graphs \cite[Chapter 5.1]{grady}. These graphs have a circulant graph Laplacian and their eigenvectors are the columns of the discrete Fourier transform matrix. Any graph can be written as the sum of circulant graphs, and \cite{ekambaram_icip,ekambaram2013globalsip,kotzagiannidis2016icassp} take advantage of this fact in designing critically sampled graph filter banks with perfect reconstruction. Another approach is to use architectures other than the critically sampled filter bank, such as lifting transforms \cite{jansen,narang_lifting_graphs} or pyramid transforms \cite{shuman_TSP_multiscale}.

Our approach in this paper, an extended version of \cite{jin_conf}, is to replace the synthesis filters with interpolation operators on each subband of the graph spectrum. While this idea was initially suggested independently in \cite{chen2015discrete}, we investigate it in more detail here. Our construction leverages the recent flurry of work in sampling and reconstruction of graph signals \cite{chen2015discrete}-\nocite{pesenson_paley,narang2013interpolation,anis2014towards,gadde2015probabilistic,shomorony,PuyTGV15,chen2015signal,tsitsvero2016uncertainty,chen2016signal,anis2016efficient}\cite{di2017sampling}. The key property we use is that any signal whose graph Fourier transform has exactly $k$ non-zero coefficients can be perfectly recovered from samples of that signal on $k$ appropriately selected vertices (see, e.g., \cite[Theorem 1]{chen2015discrete} \cite[Proposition 1]{anis2016efficient}). In Section \ref{Se:fb_design}, we present the filter bank architecture and a method to choose the downsampling sets for graphs that are small enough to perform a full eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix (say 10,000 or fewer vertices). 

Our main contributions in this extended version of the work include developing two fast versions of the proposed transform that scale efficiently for large, sparse graphs; i.e., that do not require a full eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. For the initial fast transform outlined in Section \ref{Se:fast_mcsfb}, we design the filter bank to be more amenable to polynomial approximation, estimate the number of samples required for each band, perform non-uniform random sampling for the filtered signals on each band, and use efficient convex optimization methods to reconstruct the interpolation for each band on the synthesis side. In Section \ref{Se:signal_adapted}, we develop a signal-adapted fast transform where the choices of non-uniform sampling weights and number of samples for each band depend on the actual graph signal being analyzed, as opposed to only being based on the underlying graph structure. We 
%(Section \ref{Se:samp_rec}). We then {\color{red} discuss properties of the proposed fast filter bank transform (Section \ref{Se:fast_prop}), and } 
empirically explore these two fast transforms in Section \ref{Se:ill2}, including the joint vertex-frequency localization of their dictionary atoms, the sparsity of the analysis coefficients, and the reconstruction error resulting from the numerical approximations.

\section{$M$-Channel Critically Sampled Filter Bank} \label{Se:fb_design}
%{\color{red} Intro}.

\subsection{Notation}
We consider graph signals $f \in \R^N$ residing on a weighted, undirected graph $\G=\{\V,\E,\mathbf{W}\}$, where $\V$ is the set of $N$ vertices, $\E$ is the set of edges, and $\mathbf{W}$ is the weighted adjacency matrix. 
Throughout, we take $\L$ to be the combinatorial graph Laplacian $\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{W}$, where $\mathbf{D}$ is the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees. However, our theory and proposed transform also apply to the normalized graph Laplacian $\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{W}\mathbf{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, or any other Hermitian operator. We can diagonalize the graph Laplacian as $\L=\mathbf{U}{\boldsymbol \Lambda}\mathbf{U}^{*}$, where ${\boldsymbol \Lambda}$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues $\lambda_0,\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_{N-1}$ of $\L$, and the columns ${\bf u}_0,{\bf u}_1,\ldots,{\bf u}_{N-1}$ of $\mathbf{U}$ are the associated eigenvectors of $\L$. The graph Fourier transform of a signal is $\hat{\bf{f}}=\mathbf{U}^{*}{\bf f}$, and ${h}(\L){\bf f}=\mathbf{U}{h}({\boldsymbol \Lambda})\mathbf{U}^{*}{\bf f}$ applies the filter ${h}: [0,\lambda_{\max}] \rightarrow \R$ to the graph signal ${\bf f}$. We use the notation $\mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}}$ to denote the submatrix formed by taking the columns of $\mathbf{U}$ associated with the Laplacian eigenvalues indexed by ${\cal R} \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}$. Similarly, we use the notation $\mathbf{U}_{{\cal S},{\cal R}}$ to denote the submatrix  formed by taking the rows of $\mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}}$ associated with the vertices indexed by the set ${\cal S} \subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,N\}$.

\subsection{Architecture}
We start by constructing an ideal filter bank of $M$ graph spectral filters, where for a set of band endpoints $0=\tau_0 < \tau_1 < \ldots < \tau_{M-1} \leq \tau_M$ (with $\tau_M > \lambda_{\max}$), the $m^{th}$ filter is defined as
\begin{align} \label{Eq:bandpass}
{h}_m(\lambda)=
\begin{cases}
1,& \tau_{m-1} \leq \lambda < \tau_m  \\
0,&\hbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases},~m=1,2,\ldots,M.
\end{align}
%\{\tau_m\}each filter ${h}_m(\lambda)$ is equal to 1 on a subset of the spectrum, and 0 elsewhere.
%We choose the filters so that for each $\l \in \{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}$, ${h}_m(\lambda_\l)=1$ for exactly one $m$. 
 Fig. \ref{Fig:fb} shows an example of such an ideal filter bank. Note that for each $\l \in \{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}$, ${h}_m(\lambda_\l)=1$ for exactly one $m$. 
Equivalently, we are forming a partition $\{{\cal R}_1,{\cal R}_2,\ldots,{\cal R}_M\}$ of $\{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}$ and setting
\begin{align*}
{h}_m(\lambda_{\l})=
\begin{cases}
1,&\hbox{ if } {\l} \in {\cal R}_m \\
0,&\hbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases},~m=1,2,\ldots,M.
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3.1in]{fig_filter_bank}}
\caption{Example ideal filter bank. The red, orange, yellow, green, and blue filters span 31, 31, 63, 125, and 250 graph Laplacian eigenvalues, respectively, on a 500 node sensor network with %500 vertices and 
a maximum graph Laplacian eigenvalue of 14.3. The tick marks on the x-axis represent the locations of the graph Laplacian eigenvalues.}\label{Fig:fb}
\end{figure}

The next step, which we discuss in detail in the next section, is to partition the vertex set $\V$ into subsets $\V_1,\V_2,\ldots,\V_M$ such that $\V_m$ forms a uniqueness set for $\mbox{col}\left(\mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}_m}\right)$.
%the subband ${\cal R}_m$. 
\begin{definition}[Uniqueness set \cite{pesenson_paley}] 
%Let $${\cal R}=\{r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_K\} \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}$$ be a subset of the graph Laplacian eigenvalue indices. 
Let ${\cal P}$ be a subspace of $\R^n$. 
Then a subset $\V_s$ of the vertices $\V$ is a uniqueness set for 
%the subspace $\mbox{col}\left({\mathbf{U}}_{{\cal R}}\right)=\mbox{span}\{u_{r_1},u_{r_2}\ldots,u_{r_K}\} \subseteq \R^n$ 
${\cal P}$ if  and only if for all %$f,g \in \mbox{col}\left({\mathbf{U}}_{{\cal R}}\right)$, 
${\bf f},{\bf g} \in {\cal P}$,
${\bf f}_{\V_s}={\bf g}_{\V_s}$ implies ${\bf f}={\bf g}$. That is, if two signals in ${\cal P}$ have the same values on the vertices in the uniqueness set $\V_s$, then they must be the same signal.
\end{definition}
The following equivalent characterization of a uniqueness set is often useful.
\begin{lemma}[\cite{anis2014towards}, \cite{shomorony}]\label{Le:eq_uniq}
The set $\mathcal{S}$ of $k$ vertices is a uniqueness set for $\mbox{col}({\mathbf{U}}_{\mathcal T})$ if and only if the matrix whose columns are ${\bf u}_{{\mathcal T}_1},{\bf u}_{{\mathcal T}_2},\ldots,{\bf u}_{{\mathcal T}_k}, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{{\mathcal{S}}^c_1}, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{{\mathcal{S}}^c_2}, \ldots, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{{\mathcal{S}}^c_{n-k}}$ is nonsingular,
where each ${\boldsymbol \delta}_{{\mathcal{S}}^c_i}$ is a Kronecker delta centered on a vertex not included in $S$. 
\end{lemma}
The $m^{th}$ channel of the analysis %filter 
bank %then 
filters the graph signal by an ideal %low pass 
filter on subband ${\cal R}_m$, and downsamples the result onto the vertices in $\V_m$. For synthesis, we can interpolate from the samples on $\V_m$ to $\mbox{col}\left(\mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}_m}\right)$. Namely, denoting the analysis coefficients of the $m^{th}$ branch by ${\bf y}_{\V_m}$, we have
\begin{align} \label{Eq:synth}
{\bf f}_{rec} = \sum_{m=1}^M  \mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}_m} \mathbf{U}_{\V_m,{\cal R}_m}^{-1} {\bf y}_{\V_m}.
\end{align}
% the standard least squares reconstruction is to solve $x_m^*=\argmin_{x \in \R^{k_m}} ||\mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}_m}x - y_{\V_m} ||_2$, and let $f_{m,{rec}}(\V_m)=y_{\V_m}$ and $f_{m,{rec}}(\V_m^c)=\mathbf{U}_{\V_m^c,{\cal R}_m}x_m^*$; 
If there is no error in the coefficients, then the reconstruction is perfect, because $\V_m$ is a uniqueness set for $\mbox{col}\left(\mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}_m}\right)$, ensuring $\mathbf{U}_{\V_m,{\cal R}_m}$ is full rank. Fig.\ \ref{Fig:arch} shows the architecture of the proposed $M$-channel critically sampled filter bank (M-CSFB) with interpolation on the synthesis side.

\subsection{Partitioning the graph into uniqueness sets for different frequency bands}\label{Se:partition}

In this section, we show how to partition the set of vertices into uniqueness sets for different subbands of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors. We start with the easier case of $M=2$ and then examine the general case.

\subsubsection{$M=2$ channels}
%easier result that i
First we show that if a set of vertices is a uniqueness set for a set of signals contained in a band of spectral frequencies, then the complement set of vertices is a uniqueness set for the set of signals with no energy in that band of spectral frequencies.
\begin{proposition}\label{Le:highpass_uniqueness}
On a graph ${\mathcal G}$ with $N$ vertices, let 
${\mathcal T} \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}$ denote a subset of the graph Laplacian eigenvalue indices, and let ${\mathcal T}^c=\{0,1,\ldots,N-1\} \setminus {\mathcal T}$.
Then 
$\mathcal{S}^c$ is a uniqueness set for $\mbox{col}({\mathbf{U}}_{{\mathcal T}^c})$
 if and only if
$\mathcal{S}$ is a uniqueness set for 
$\mbox{col}({\mathbf{U}}_{{\mathcal T}})$.
\end{proposition}
This fact follows from either the CS decomposition \cite[Equation (32)]{paige})
%of C.C. Paige and M. Wei, "History and generality of the CS decomposition," Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 1992), 
or the nullity theorem \cite[Theorem 2.1]{strangInterplay}.  
%of G. Strang and T. Nguyen, "The interplay of ranks and submatrices," SIAM Review, 2004). 
We also provide a standalone proof below that only requires that the space spanned by the first $k$ columns of ${\mathbf{U}}$ is orthogonal to the space spanned by the last $N-k$ columns, not that ${\mathbf{U}}$ is an orthogonal matrix.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{Le:highpass_uniqueness}]
We assume without loss of generality that ${\mathcal T}=\{0,1,2,\ldots,k-1\}$. 
Suppose first that the set $\mathcal{S}$ is a uniqueness set for $\mbox{col}({\mathbf{U}}_{\mathcal T})$, but $\mathcal{S}^c$ is not a uniqueness set for $\mbox{col}({\mathbf{U}}_{{\mathcal T}^c})$. Then by Lemma \ref{Le:eq_uniq}, the matrix $$\mathbf{A}=
 \left[ \begin{array}{cccccccc}
{\bf u}_{0} & {\bf u}_{1} & \cdots & {\bf u}_{k-1} & {\boldsymbol \delta}_{{\mathcal{S}}^c_1} & {\boldsymbol \delta}_{{\mathcal{S}}^c_2} \cdots & {\boldsymbol \delta}_{{\mathcal{S}}^c_{N-k}} \end{array} \right]$$
has full rank, and the matrix $$\mathbf{B}=
 \left[ \begin{array}{cccccccc}
{\bf u}_{k} & {\bf u}_{k+1} & \cdots & {\bf u}_{N-1} & {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{1}} & {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{2}} \cdots & {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_k} \end{array} \right]$$
is singular, implying
\begin{align}\label{Eq:span}
\mbox{span}({\bf u}_{k}, {\bf u}_{k+1},\ldots, {\bf u}_{N-1}, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{1}}, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{2}}, \ldots, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_k}) \neq \mathbb{R}^N.
\end{align}
Since 
$$\mbox{dim}(\mbox{span}({\bf u}_{k}, {\bf u}_{k+1},\ldots, {\bf u}_{N-1}))=N-k$$ and $$\mbox{dim}(\mbox{span}({\boldsymbol \delta}_{S_{1}}, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{S_{2}}, \ldots, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_k}))=k,$$ equation 
\eqref{Eq:span} implies that
there must exist a vector ${\bf x} \neq {\bf 0}$ such that 
\begin{align*}
&{\bf x} \in  \mbox{span}({\bf u}_{k}, {\bf u}_{k+1},\ldots, {\bf u}_{N-1})  \hbox{ and } \\
& {\bf x} \in \mbox{span}({\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{1}}, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{2}}, \ldots, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{k}}).\end{align*}
Yet, ${\bf x} \in \mbox{col}({\mathbf{U}}_{{\mathcal T}^c})$ implies ${\bf x}$ is orthogonal to  ${\bf u}_0, {\bf u}_1, \ldots, {\bf u}_{k-1}$, and, similarly, 
${\bf x} \in \mbox{span}({\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{1}}, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{2}}, \ldots, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}_{k}})$ implies ${\bf x}$ is orthogonal to ${\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}^c_{1}}, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}^c_{2}}, \ldots, {\boldsymbol \delta}_{\mathcal{S}^c_{N-k}}.$
In matrix notation, we have $\mathbf{A}^{\top}{\bf x}={\bf 0}$, so $\mathbf{A}^{\top}$ has a non-trivial null space, and thus the square matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is not full rank and $\mathcal{S}$ is not a uniqueness set for $\mbox{col}({\mathbf{U}}_{\mathcal T})$, a contradiction. We conclude that if $\mathbf{A}$ is full rank, then $\mathbf{B}$ must be full rank and $\mathcal{S}^c$ is a uniqueness set for $\mbox{col}({\mathbf{U}}_{{\mathcal T}^c})$, completing the proof of sufficiency. Necessity follows from the same argument, with the roles of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ interchanged.
\end{proof}

The Steinitz exchange lemma \cite{steinitz} guarantees that we can find the uniqueness set $\mathcal{S}$ (and thus $\mathcal{S}^c$), and the graph signal processing literature contains methods such as Algorithm 1 of \cite{shomorony} to do so.

\subsubsection{$M>2$ channels}
The issue with using the methods of Proposition \ref{Le:highpass_uniqueness} for the case of $M>2$ is that while the submatrix ${\mathbf{U}}_{{\mathcal S^c},{\mathcal T^c}}$ is nonsingular, it is not necessarily orthogonal, and so we cannot proceed with an inductive argument. The following proposition and corollary circumvent this issue by only using the nonsingularity of the original matrix. The proof of the following proposition is due to Federico Poloni \cite{poloni}, %of the University of Pisa via mathoverflow.net
and we later discovered the same method in \cite{greeneMultiple}, \cite[Theorem 3.3]{greene_magnanti}.
\begin{proposition}\label{Pr:mat_part}
Let $\mathbf{A}$ be an $N \times N$ nonsingular matrix, and $\beta=\{\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_M\}$ be a partition of $\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$. Then there exists another partition $\alpha=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_M\}$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$ with $|\alpha_i|=|\beta_i|$ for all $i$ such that the $M$ square submatrices $\mathbf{A}_{\alpha_i,\beta_i}$ are all nonsingular.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}%[Proof of Proposition \ref{Pr:part_uniq}]
First consider the case $M=2$, and let $k=|\beta_1|$. Then by the generalized Laplace expansion \cite{gle}, 
\begin{align}\label{Eq:det2}
\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})~=~\sum_{\mathclap{\{\alpha_1 \subset \{1,2,\ldots,N\}: |\alpha_1|=k \}}}~~\sigma_{\alpha_1,\beta_1} \mbox{det}(\mathbf{A}_{\alpha_1,\beta_1})\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A}_{\alpha_1^c,\beta_2}),
\end{align}
where the sign $\sigma_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}$ of the permutation determined by $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ is equal to 1 or -1. Since $\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\neq 0$, one of the terms in the summation of \eqref{Eq:det2} must be nonzero, ensuring a choice of $\alpha_1$ such that the submatrices $\mathbf{A}_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}$ and $\mathbf{A}_{\alpha_1^c,\beta_2}$ are nonsingular. We can choose $\{\alpha_1,\alpha_1^c\}$ as the desired partition. For $M>2$, by induction, we have
\begin{align}\label{Eq:detM}
\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})~=~\sum_{\mathclap{\{\hbox{Partitions } \alpha \hbox{ of }\{1,2,\ldots,N\}: |\alpha_i|=|\beta_i|~\forall i \}}}~~\sigma_{\alpha}~{\textstyle \prod_{i=1}^M}~\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A}_{\alpha_i,\beta_i}),
\end{align}
where again $\sigma_\alpha$ is always 1 or -1 and one of the terms in the summation in \eqref{Eq:detM} must be nonzero, yielding the desired partition. 
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{Co:part_uniq}
For any %arbitrary 
partition $\{{\cal R}_1,{\cal R}_2,\ldots {\cal R}_M \}$ of the graph Laplacian eigenvalue indices $\{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}$ into $M$ subsets, there exists a partition $\{\V_1,\V_2,\ldots,\V_M\}$ of the graph vertices into $M$ subsets 
such that for every $m \in \{1,2,\ldots,M\}$, $|\V_m|=|{\cal R}_m|$ and 
%of corresponding sizes such that each subset 
$\V_m$ is a uniqueness set for $\mbox{col}\left(\mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}_m}\right)$.%of the vertices is the uniqueness set for each of the bandwidth sets.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{Pr:mat_part}, we can find a partition such that $\mathbf{U}_{\V_m,{\cal R}_m}$ is nonsingular for all $m$. Let $\mathbf{E}_m$ be the matrix formed by joining the $k_m$ columns of  $\mathbf{U}$ indexed by ${\cal R}_m$ with $N-k_m$ Kronecker deltas centered on all vertices not included in $\V_m$. By Lemma \ref{Le:eq_uniq}, it suffices to show that the matrices $\mathbf{E}_m$ are all nonsingular. Yet, for all $m$, we have
$$|\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_m)|=|\mbox{det}(\mathbf{U}_{\V_m,{\cal R}_m})| \neq 0.$$
\end{proof}

Corollary \ref{Co:part_uniq} ensures the existence of the desired partition, and the proof of Proposition \ref{Pr:mat_part} suggests that we can find it inductively. However, given a partition of the columns of ${\mathbf{A}}$ into two sets $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}^c$, Proposition \ref{Pr:mat_part} does not provide a constructive method to partition the rows of ${\mathbf{A}}$ into two sets $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{S}^c$ such that the submatrices ${\mathbf{A}}_{{\mathcal{S}},{\mathcal{T}}}$ and ${\mathbf{A}}_{{\mathcal{S}^c},{\mathcal{T}}^c}$ are nonsingular. This problem is studied in the more general framework of matroid theory in \cite{greene_magnanti}, which gives an algorithm to find the desired row partition into two sets. We summarize this method in Algorithm \ref{Al:uniqueness}, which takes in a partition $\{{\cal R}_1,{\cal R}_2,\ldots {\cal R}_M \}$ of the spectral indices and constructs the partition $\{\V_1,\V_2,\ldots,\V_M\}$ of the vertices. In Fig. \ref{Fig:part_examples}, we show two examples of the resulting partitions.

\begin{remark}
While Algorithm \ref{Al:uniqueness} always finds a partition into uniqueness sets, such a partition is usually not unique. The initial choices of $\gamma_i$ in each loop play a significant role in the final 
partition. In the numerical experiments in Section \ref{Se:ill1}, we use the greedy algorithm in \cite[Algorithm 1]{shomorony}  to find an initial choice for $\gamma_1$, %and use row reduction after

%\section{Dictionary Atoms and Signals that are Sparsely Represented by the MCSFB Transform}
\subsection{Transform properties}
%{\color{red} Move this section until the end and discuss both the exact and approximate transforms together?}
We now briefly examine some properties of the proposed transform. 
\subsubsection{Dictionary atoms}
Let ${\bf M}_m \in \R^{|{\cal V}_m| \times N}$ be the downsampling matrix for the $m^{th}$ channel. That is, ${\bf M}_m(i,j)=1$ if vertex $j$ is the $i^{th}$ element of ${\cal V}_m$, and 0 otherwise. The proposed transform is a linear mapping ${\cal F}: \R^N \rightarrow \R^N$ by ${\cal F}{\bf f} = {\bf Tf}$, where 
\begin{align*}
{\bf T}=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
{\bf M}_1 h_1(\L) \\  \hdashline[.05cm/.05cm]
{\bf M}_2 h_2(\L) \\  \hdashline[.05cm/.05cm]
\vdots \\  \hdashline[.05cm/.05cm]
{\bf M}_M h_M(\L)
\end{array}
\right] \in \R^{N \times N}.
\end{align*}
The atoms of the resulting dictionary are given by the columns of ${\bf T}^{\top}$. While the transform is not orthogonal, each atom is orthogonal to all atoms concentrated on other spectral bands. Informally, this is because the atoms are projections of Kronecker deltas onto the orthogonal subspaces spanned by the Laplacian eigenvectors of each band. More formally, each atom is of the form $h_m(\L){\boldsymbol \delta}_i$, where vertex $i$ is in ${\cal V}_m$. If $m \neq m^{\prime}$, then the inner product of the two atoms from different bands is given by
\begin{align} \label{Eq:ortho_bands}
&\langle h_m(\L){\boldsymbol \delta}_i , h_{m^{\prime}}(\L){\boldsymbol \delta}_{i^{\prime}} \rangle \nonumber \\
&~~~~~~= {\boldsymbol \delta}_i^{\top} {\bf U} h_m({\boldsymbol \Lambda}) {\bf U}^* {\bf U} h_{m^{\prime}}({\boldsymbol \Lambda}) {\bf U}^* {\boldsymbol \delta}_{i^{\prime}}= 0,
\end{align}
since ${\bf U}^* {\bf U}={\bf I}$ and $h_m(\lambda)h_{m^{\prime}}(\lambda)=0$ for all $\lambda$ by design.
%One possible extension is to find a fast algorithm to orthogonalize the atoms within each band. 
Note also that the wavelet atoms at all scales ($m>1$) have mean zero, as they have no energy at eigenvalue zero.


\subsubsection{Signals that are sparsely represented by the M-CSFB transform}
Globally smooth signals trivially lead to sparse analysis coefficients because the coefficients are only nonzero for first set of vertices in the partition. More generally, signals that are concentrated in the graph Fourier domain %necessarily 
have sparse M-CSFB analysis coefficients, because the coefficients for any channel whose filter does not overlap with the support of the signal in the graph Fourier domain are all equal to zero. %Similarly, if the spectral coefficients decay, the transform coefficients should decay.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Joint vertex-frequency localization of atoms and example analysis coefficients}
We start by empirically showing that the dictionary atoms (the columns of $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$) are jointly localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. On the Stanford bunny graph \cite{bunny} with 2503 vertices, we partition the spectrum into five bands, and show the resulting partition into uniqueness sets 
in Fig.\ \ref{Fig:bunny_signal}(c). The first row of Fig.\ \ref{Fig:bunny_coef} shows five different example atoms whose energy is concentrated on different spectral bands. We see that these atoms are generally localized in the vertex domain as well. Some atoms such as the one shown at wavelet scale 3 are more spread in the vertex domain, possibly as a result of using ideal filters in the filter bank, an issue we revisit in Section \ref{Se:fast_prop}. The second row of Fig.\ \ref{Fig:bunny_coef} shows the spectral content of all atoms in each band, with the average for each represented by a thick black line. As expected, the energies of the atoms are localized in the spectral domain as well. 

Next we apply the proposed transform to a piecewise-smooth graph signal $f$ that is shown in the vertex domain in Fig.\ \ref{Fig:bunny_signal}(a), and in the graph spectral domain in Fig.\ \ref{Fig:bunny_signal}(b). The full set of analysis coefficients is shown in Fig.\ \ref{Fig:bunny_signal}(d), and these are separated by band in the third row of Fig.\ \ref{Fig:bunny_coef}. We see that with the exception of the lowpass channel, the coefficients are clustered around the two main discontinuities (around the midsection and tail of the bunny). The bottom row of Fig.\ \ref{Fig:bunny_coef} shows the interpolation of these coefficients onto the corresponding spectral bands, and if we sum these reconstructions together, we recover exactly the original signal in Fig.\ \ref{Fig:bunny_signal}(a).


\subsection{Sparse approximation}
Next, we compress 
a piecewise-smooth graph signal ${\bf f}$ via the sparse coding optimization
\begin{align}\label{Eq:sparse_coding}
\argmin_{\bf x}   || {\bf f}-\boldsymbol{\Phi}{\bf x} ||_2^2 \hbox{~~~subject to } ||{\bf x}||_0 \leq T,
\end{align}
where $T$ is a predefined sparsity level. After %first 
normalizing the atoms of various critically-sampled dictionaries, we use the greedy %approximately solve the optimization problem
 % with 
 orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm \cite{tropp2004greed,elad_book} to approximately solve \eqref{Eq:sparse_coding}. 
  We show the reconstruction errors in Fig. \ref{Fig:comp}(d). 
 For the $M$-CSFB, %channel filter bank, 
 Fig. \ref{Fig:part_examples} shows 
 the partition into uniqueness sets, and  
 Fig. \ref{Fig:fb} shows the filter bank.

 %filter bank is shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:fb}.

\section{Fast M-CSFB Transform} \label{Se:fast_mcsfb}
%\section{Polynomial Filter Bank Design} \label{Se:filt_design}
In the numerical examples in the previous sections, we have computed a full eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian and subsequently used it for all three of the filtering, sampling, and interpolation operations; however, such an eigendecomposition does not scale well with the size of the graph as it requires ${\cal O}(N^3)$ operations with naive methods. In these next three sections, we develop a fast approximate version of the proposed transform that scales more efficiently for large, sparse graphs. 

\subsection{Approximation by polynomial filters} \label{Se:poly_approx}

Fast, approximate methods for computing $h_m(\L){\bf f}$ a function of sparse matrix times a vector, include approximating the function $h_m(\cdot)$ by a polynomial (e.g., via a truncated Chebyshev or Legendre expansion), approximating $h_m(\cdot)$ by a rational function, Krylov space methods (Lanczos in our case of a symmetric matrix $\L$), the matrix version of the Cauchy integral theorem (see, e.g., \cite{higham}\nocite{davies2005computing, frommer}-\cite{dubious} and references therein). The first three of these methods have been examined in graph signal processing settings \cite{hammond2011wavelets,PuyTGV15},  \cite{shuman_distributed_sipn}\nocite{susnjara, shi2015infinite}-\cite{loukas2015distributed}. While all of these could be used to approximate the filters in the analysis step of the proposed filter bank, we focus on order $K$ Chebyshev polynomial approximations of the form
\begin{align}\label{Eq:cheb}
\tilde{h}(\L){\bf f} := \sum_{k=0}^K \alpha_k \bar{T}_k(\L){\bf f}.
\end{align}
In \eqref{Eq:cheb}, $\bar{T}_k(\cdot)$ are Chebyshev polynomials shifted to the interval $[0,\lambda_{\max}]$. Thus,  $\bar{T}_0(\L){\bf f} = {\bf f}$, $\bar{T}_1(\L){\bf f} = \frac{2}{\lambda_{\max}}\L{\bf f}-{\bf f}$, and for $k\geq 2$, by the three term recurrence relation of Chebyshev polynomials, we have
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Tkbar_rec}
\bar{T}_k(\L){\bf f} = \frac{4}{\lambda_{\max}}\left(\L-\frac{\lambda_{\max}}{2}{\bf I}\right)\bar{T}_{k-1}(\L){\bf f}-\bar{T}_{k-2}(\L){\bf f}.
\end{align}


%{\color{blue}
The coefficients in \eqref{Eq:cheb} are often taken to be $\alpha_0=\frac{1}{2}c_0$ and $\alpha_k=c_k$ for $k=1,2,\ldots,K$, where  $\{c_k\}_{k=0,\ldots,K}$ are the truncated Chebyshev expansion coefficients 
%\cite{jay} formula
\begin{align}\label{Eq:cheb_coeff}
c_{k}&:=\langle h , \bar{T}_k \rangle \nonumber \\&~= \frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\cos(k\phi)~h\Bigl(\frac{\lambda_{\max}}{2} \bigl(\cos(\phi) +1\bigr)\Bigr)~d\phi.
\end{align}
However, the oscillations that arise in Chebyshev polynomial approximations of bandpass filters may result in larger values of $\tilde{h}_m(\lambda)\tilde{h}_{m^{\prime}}(\lambda)$, even when the ideal filters $h_m(\cdot)$ and $h_{m^{\prime}}(\cdot)$ have supports that do not come close to overlapping. This negates the orthogonality of the atoms across bands shown in \eqref{Eq:ortho_bands}. In an attempt to at least preserve \emph{near} orthogonality across bands, we

%%\item $c_k$ formula for truncated Chebyshev expansion
%\item However
%%\item To compute $g_i(\L)f$, Matrix function times a vector literature (2-3 general surveys, graph signal processing literature) the polynomial approximation method discussed in \cite{hammond2011wavelets,shuman_DCOSS_2011}

%\end{itemize}
%}
therefore use the Jackson-Chebyshev polynomial approximations from \cite{di2016efficient,puy_structured_sampling} that damp the Gibbs oscillations appearing in Chebyshev expansions. With the damping, 
\begin{align}\label{Eq:damping1}
\alpha_0=\frac{1}{2}c_0 \hbox{ and }\alpha_k=\gamma_{k,K}c_k \hbox{ for }k=1,2,\ldots,K, 
\end{align}
where, as presented in \cite{di2016efficient}, 
\begin{align}
\gamma_{k,K} &= \frac{\left(1-\frac{k}{K+2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{K+2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{K+2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{K+2}\right)} \nonumber \\
&~~~~+~\frac{\frac{1}{K+2}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{K+2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{K+2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{K+2}\right)}. \label{Eq:damping2}
\end{align}

\subsection{Filter bank design}

We can quantify the worst case error introduced when approximating  $h_m(\cdot)$ by an approximant $\tilde{h}_m(\cdot)$ as follows:
\begin{align} \label{Eq:poly_approx_error}
&||\tilde{h}_m(\L)-h_m(\L) ||_2  \nonumber \\ &~~~~~~~= \max_{\l \in \{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}}|\tilde{h}_m(\lambda_{\l})-h_m(\lambda_{\l}) |  \nonumber \\
 &~~~~~~~\leq \max_{\lambda \in [0,\lambda_{\max}]}|\tilde{h}_m(\lambda)-h_m(\lambda) |.
\end{align}
While approximation theory often aims to minimize the upper bound in \eqref{Eq:poly_approx_error}, only the errors exactly at the graph Laplacian eigenvalues affect the overall approximation error $||\tilde{h}_m(\L)-h_m(\L) ||_2$. Since, as seen in Fig. \ref{Fig:approx_filtering_error}, the errors of the Jackson-Chebyshev polynomial approximation are concentrated around the discontinuities of $h_m(\cdot)$, a guiding principle when designing the filter bank to be more amenable to fast approximation is to choose the endpoints $\{\tau_m\}_{m=1,\ldots,M-1}$ of the bandpass filters to be in gaps in the graph Laplacian spectrum. Unfortunately, we do not have access to the exact graph Laplacian eigenvalues (the reason for introducing this approximation in the first place is that they are too expensive to compute for large graphs); however, we can efficiently estimate the density of the spectrum in order to design the filters in a way that aims to have the endpoints close to fewer eigenvalues of $\L$.

\subsubsection{Estimating the spectral density} \label{Se:spectral_density}

Lin et al. \cite{lin_spectral_density} provide an excellent overview of methods to approximate the \emph{spectral density function} \cite[Chapter 6]{van_mieghem}) (also called the \emph{Density of States} or \emph{empirical spectral distribution} \cite[Chapter 2.4]{tao_random_matrix}) of a matrix, which in our context for the graph Laplacian $\L$ is the probability measure 
\begin{align*}
p_{\lambda}(s):=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{\l=0}^{N-1} \Identity_{\left\{\lambda_{\l}=s\right\}}.
\end{align*}
Here, we use a variant of the Kernel Polynomial Method \cite{silver1994densities}\nocite{silver1996kernel}-\cite{wang1994calculating} described in \cite{lin_spectral_density} to estimate the \emph{cumulative spectral density function} or \emph{empirical spectral cumulative distribution}
\begin{align}
P_{\lambda}(z):=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{\l=0}^{N-1} \Identity_{\left\{\lambda_{\l}\leq z\right\}}.
\end{align}
The procedure %{\color{red}, outlined in Algorithm  XXX,} 
starts by estimating $\lambda_{\max}$, for example via the power iteration. Then for each of $T$ linearly spaced points $\xi_i$ between 0 and $\lambda_{\max}$, we use Hutchinson's stochastic trace estimator \cite{hutchinson} to estimate $\eta_i$, the number of eigenvalues less than or equal to $\xi_i$. Defining the Heaviside function $\Theta_{\xi_i}(\lambda):=\Identity_{\left\{\lambda \leq \xi_i\right\}},$ we have
\begin{align}
\eta_i =\mbox{tr}\Bigl(\Theta_{\xi_i}(\L)\Bigr) 
&=\mathbb{E}[{\bf x}^{\top}\Theta_{\xi_i}(\L){\bf x}] \label{Eq:hutch1}\\
&\approx \frac{1}{J} \sum_{j=1}^J {{\bf x}^{(j)}}^{\top}\Theta_{\xi_i}(\L){\bf x}^{(j)} \label{Eq:hutch2} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{J} \sum_{j=1}^J {{\bf x}^{(j)}}^{\top}\tilde{\Theta}_{\xi_i}(\L){\bf x}^{(j)}. \label{Eq:hutch3}
\end{align}
In \eqref{Eq:hutch1}, ${\bf x}$ is a random vector with each component having an independent and identical standard normal distribution. Each vector  ${\bf x}^{(j)}$ in \eqref{Eq:hutch2} is chosen according to this same distribution, and in our experiments, we take the default number of vectors to be $J=30$. In \eqref{Eq:hutch3}, $\tilde{\Theta}_{\xi_i}$ is the Jackson-Chebyshev approximation to ${\Theta}_{\xi_i}$ discussed in Section \ref{Se:poly_approx}, with a default polynomial order of $K=30$. If we place the $J$ random vectors into the columns of an $N \times J$ matrix ${\bf X}$, the computational cost of estimating the spectral distribution is dominated by computing 
\begin{align} \label{Eq:hutch4}
\tilde{\Theta}_{\xi_i}(\L){\bf X}=\sum_{k=0}^K \alpha_k \bar{T}_k(\L){\bf X}
\end{align}
 for each $\xi_i$. Yet, %the $\alpha_k$'s for each ${\Theta}_{\xi_i}$ can be computed in closed form, and 
we only need to compute $\{ \bar{T}_k(\L){\bf X}\}_{k=0,1,\ldots,K}$ recursively once, as this sequence can be reused for each $\xi_i$, with different choices of the $\alpha_k$'s. Therefore, the overall computational cost is ${\cal O}(KJ|\E|)$.

As in \cite{shuman2013spectrum}, once we compute the eigenvalue count estimates $\{\eta_i\}$, we approximate the empirical spectral cumulative distribution $P_{\lambda}(\cdot)$ by performing monotonic piecewise cubic interpolation \cite{fritsch} on the series of points $\left\{\left(\xi_i,\frac{\eta_i}{N}\right)\right\}_{i=1,2,\ldots,T}$. We denote the result as $\tilde{P}_{\lambda}(\cdot)$.




\subsubsection{Choosing initial band ends}

When selecting the band ends $\{\tau_m\}$ for each of the $M$ ideal filters, we consider two factors: spectrum-adaptation and spacing. In our implementation, the filter bank can either be adapted to the spectral distribution or just to the support of the spectrum $[0,\lambda_{\max}]$, and it can be either evenly or logarithmically spaced (four options in all). For example, if the filter bank is only adapted to the support of the spectrum and is evenly spaced, then $\tau_m=\frac{m}{M}\lambda_{\max}$. Fig. \ref{Fig:fb_design}(a) shows a spectrum-adapted, logarithmically spaced choice with $\tau_m=\tilde{P}^{-1}_{\lambda}\Bigl(\frac{1}{2}^{M-m}\Bigr)$ for $m=1,2,\ldots,M$, such that approximately half of the eigenvalues are in the highest band, a quarter in the next highest band, and so forth.

\subsubsection{Adjusting the band ends} \label{Se:adjust}

In order to make the filters more amenable to approximation, we then adjust the initial choice of band endpoints so that they lie in lower density regions of the spectrum. Specifically, for each $m=1,2,\ldots,M-1$ and some choice of $\Delta>0$, we let the final endpoint be
\begin{align} \label{Eq:adjustment}
\tau_m^* = \argmin_{\tau \in {\cal I}_m} \left\{\frac{\tilde{P}_{\lambda}(\tau+\Delta)-\tilde{P}_{\lambda}(\tau-\Delta)}{2\Delta}\right\},
\end{align}
%search for the minimizer of $\frac{\tilde{P}_{\lambda}(\cdot)}{2 \Delta}$ 
where ${\cal I}_m$ is an interval around the initial choice of $\tau_m$. Fig. \ref{Fig:fb_design}(c) shows the objective function in \eqref{Eq:adjustment}, along with the initial band ends, search intervals, and adjusted band ends. Comparing Fig. \ref{Fig:fb_design}(b) and Fig. \ref{Fig:fb_design}(d), we 
see that adjusting the band ends leads to fewer eigenvalues falling close to the borders of the filters, reducing the error incurred by the polynomial approximation process. Algorithm \ref{Al:filter_bank} summarizes the proposed filter bank design in the case of spectrum-adapted and logarithmically spaced filters.

%\section{Non-Uniform Random Sampling and Reconstruction} \label{Se:samp_rec}
%Both the partitioning of the vertices into uniqueness sets described in Algorithm 1 and the synthesis via interpolation in \eqref{Eq:synth} require a full eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian to compute the matrix ${\bf U}$. In this section, we examine more efficient sampling and reconstruction methods that do not require the full eigendecomposition.


\subsection{Non-uniform random sampling distribution}
The partitioning of the vertices into uniqueness sets described in Algorithm 1 requires a full eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian to compute the matrix ${\bf U}$. Two broad approaches to more efficient sampling have recently been investigated: greedy methods \cite{chen2015discrete,anis2014towards,tsitsvero2016uncertainty,anis2016efficient} and random sampling methods \cite{shomorony,PuyTGV15,chen2016signal}, which have close connections to \emph{leverage score} sampling in the statistics and numerical linear algebra literature (see, e.g., \cite{drineas2012fast}\nocite{mahoney2009cur,boutsidis2009improved}-\cite{mahoney2011randomized}). Reference \cite{anis2016efficient} has a nice review of the computational complexities of the various greedy routines for identifying uniqueness sets. Most of these are designed specifically for lowpass signals. 
 
We adapt the non-uniform random sampling method of \cite{PuyTGV15}, which scales more efficiently than greedy methods. Namely, for the $m^{th}$ band, we identify the downsampling set $\V_m$ by sampling the vertices $\V$ without replacement according to a discrete probability distribution ${\boldsymbol \omega}_m$. To minimize the graph weighted coherence, it is ideal to take ${\boldsymbol \omega}_m(i) \propto ||{\bf U}_{{\cal R}_m}^{\top} {\boldsymbol \delta}_i ||_2^2$ \cite{PuyTGV15}; however, we do not have access to ${\bf U}_{{\cal R}_m}$. Instead, we take 
\begin{align}\label{Eq:samp_dist}
{\boldsymbol \omega}_m(i) \propto ||(\tilde{h}_m(\L){\bf X})^{\top} {\boldsymbol \delta}_i ||_2^2,
\end{align}
which \cite{PuyTGV15} shows is an unbiased estimator of $||{\bf U}_{{\cal R}_m}^{\top} {\boldsymbol \delta}_i ||_2^2$ when ${\bf X}$ is the random matrix from \eqref{Eq:hutch4}. Since we already compute and store the series of matrices $\bar{T}_k(\L){\bf X}$ for the spectral density estimation of Section \ref{Se:spectral_density}, we just need to compute the polynomial approximation coefficients $\{\alpha_k\}$ in \eqref{Eq:hutch4} for $h_m(\lambda)$ in order to compute $\tilde{h}_m(\L){\bf X}$.

% The random sampling method proposed in \cite{PuyTGV15} does not require the full eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian and therefore scales significantly better with the size of the graph.
%We are currently examining whether there is a way to extend the approach of \cite{PuyTGV15} to non-uniformly randomly sample in a manner that leads with high probability to uniqueness sets for higher bands of the graph Laplacian spectrum. 


Intuitively, the sampling distribution approximates the energy of the selected eigenvectors concentrated on each vertex. In the extreme case that the selected eigenvectors are completely concentrated on a single vertex or small neighborhood of vertices, sampling signal values outside of this set provides no additional information, justifying the zero weight in the sampling distribution. For eigenvectors whose energy is equally spread across the graph, this results in uniform sampling. In particular, for any walk-regular graph, a class that includes vertex-transitive graphs, which in turn include shift-invariant graphs such as the cycle graph, $||{\bf U}_{{\cal R}}^{\top} {\boldsymbol \delta}_i ||_2^2$ is constant across vertices $i$ for any choice of eigenvectors ${\cal R}$ \cite[Corollary 3.2]{chan1997symmetry}, resulting in uniform random sampling for all bands. % for any choice of (e.g., the discrete Fourier transform eigenvectors for a shift-invariant graph),
As discussed in \cite[Section 5.1.2]{PuyTGV15}, non-uniform sampling is particularly beneficial when eigenvectors are more localized, and is especially important for the bandpass and highpass filters we include in the filter bank. For the low end of the spectrum with smooth eigenvectors, the intuition is that it is easier to interpolate missing values in highly connected regions of the graph, and therefore there are slightly higher weights on the less connected vertices (e.g., near the boundaries in Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(g)).
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Add intuition about which nodes receive high weights and diagram of the matrix to support that. Then refer to figures.
%\item Note that the benefits of non-uniform sampling come when eigenvectors are more localized (c.f., Section 5.1.2 of Gilles' paper); this is especially important for high pass filters

\subsection{Number of samples}

To yield a critically sampled transform, one option is to choose the number of samples for each band to be in correspondence with the initial filter bank design. For example, if the filter bank is designed to be adapted to the spectrum with logarithmic spacing, we can choose $\frac{N}{2}$ samples for the highest band, $\frac{N}{4}$ for the next highest, and so forth. However, the adjustments we make in Section \ref{Se:adjust} affect the number of eigenvalues contained in each band. Since we have an estimate of the cumulative spectral distribution, one approximation for the number of samples in the adjusted $m^{th}$ band is to round $N \cdot (\tilde{P}_{\lambda}(\tau_{m})-\tilde{P}_{\lambda}(\tau_{m-1}))$. As a band end $\tau_m$ may fall at a point where $\tilde{P}_\lambda$ has been interpolated via cubic functions, another option is to estimate the number of eigenvalues between $\tau_{m-1}$ and $\tau_m$, once again with the stochastic trace estimator in \eqref{Eq:hutch3}, except using the bandpass filter $h_m(\lambda)$ from \eqref{Eq:bandpass}. We already compute $\tilde{h}_m(\L){\bf X}$ to calculate the sampling distribution in \eqref{Eq:samp_dist}. We can substitute the columns $\tilde{h}_m(\L){\bf x}^{(j)}$ of this matrix into 
%Since we have already computed and stored the series of matrices $\bar{T}_k(\L){\bf X}$, we just need to compute the polynomial approximation coefficients $\{\alpha_k\}$ in \eqref{Eq:hutch4} for  $h_m(\lambda)$, and substitute the resulting $\tilde{h}_m(\L){\bf x}^{(j)}$ values into 
\eqref{Eq:hutch3} for an estimate of the number of eigenvalues in the $m^{th}$ band. An added benefit of this extra step is that the thresholds $\{\tau_m\}$ are chosen to be in areas of low spectral density, which improves the accuracy of the eigenvalue count estimate \cite{di2016efficient}. 
%If critical sampling is desired, w

We can make small adjustments to ensure the total number of samples is equal to some target $N_T$, which we take to be equal to $N$ in our experiments to ensure critical sampling. Our default is to add samples to the lowest band if the normalized total is lower than $N_T$, and remove samples from the highest band if the normalized total is higher than $N_T$. We summarize the proposed method to choose the downsampling sets in Algorithm \ref{Al:downsampling}.

Note that due to the polynomial approximation, the dimension of $\hbox{col}(\tilde{h}_m(\L))$ is at least as large as the dimension of $\hbox{col}({h}_m(\L))$, with the difference depending on the number of Laplacian eigenvalues just outside the end points of $h_m(\cdot)$ and the degree of approximation used for $\tilde{h}_m(\cdot)$. Therefore, we expect that to perfectly reconstruct signals in $\hbox{col}(\tilde{h}_m(\L))$, we need more samples than the number of eigenvalues in the support of $h_m(\cdot)$. In Section \ref{Se:ill2}, we explore how the reconstruction error is reduced as we increase the number of samples in each band. The tradeoff is the loss of critical sampling, as the total number of samples extends beyond $N$.

\subsection{Interpolation}
The exact interpolation \eqref{Eq:synth} requires the eigenvector matrix ${\bf U}$, and in case $U_{\V_m,{\cal R}_m}$ is not full rank, the standard least squares reconstruction for the $m^{th}$ channel
\begin{align}
{\bf f}_{m,{rec}}=\mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}_m}(\mathbf{U}_{\V_m,{\cal R}_m}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{\V_m,{\cal R}_m})^{-1}\mathbf{U}_{\V_m,{\cal R}_m}^{\top}{\bf y}_{\V_m}
\end{align}
also requires ${\bf U}_{{\cal R}_m}$. One option explored in \cite{halko,paratte} is to leverage $\{\bar{T}_k(\L){\bf X}\}$ again to approximate the column space of ${\bf U}_{{\cal R}_m}$ by filtering at least $|{\cal R}_m|$ standard normal random vectors with the filter $\tilde{h}_m(\cdot)$, possibly followed by orthonormalization via QR factorization.


A second approach suggested in \cite{PuyTGV15} to efficiently reconstruct lowpass signals is to relax the optimization problem
\begin{align*}
\min_{{\bf z} \in \hbox{col}({\bf U}_{{\cal R}_m})} ||{\boldsymbol \Omega}_{m,\V_m}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left({\bf M_m z}-{{\bf y}_{\V_m}} \right) ||_2^2
\end{align*} 
to 
\begin{align}\label{Eq:approx_rec_opt}
\min_{{\bf z} \in \R^N} \left\{{\bf z}^{\top}\varphi_m(\L){\bf z} + \kappa ||{\boldsymbol \Omega}_{m,\V_m}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left({\bf M_m z}-{{\bf y}_{\V_m}} \right) ||_2^2\right\},
\end{align} 
where ${\boldsymbol \Omega}_{m,\V_m}$ is a $|\V_m| \times |\V_m|$  diagonal matrix with the $m^{th}$ channel sampling weights of $\V_m$ along the diagonal, and $\kappa>0$ is a parameter to trade off the two optimization objectives. The regularization term ${\bf z}^{\top}\varphi_m(\L){\bf z}$ in \eqref{Eq:approx_rec_opt} penalizes reconstructions with support outside of the desired spectral band. For lowpass signals, Puy et al. \cite{PuyTGV15} take the penalty function $\varphi_m(\lambda)$ to be a nonnegative, nondecreasing polynomial, such as $\lambda^l$, with $l$ a positive integer. For more general classes of signals (i.e., the midpass and highpass signals output from the higher bands of the proposed filter bank), it is important to keep the nonnegativity property, in order to ensure that $\varphi_m(\L)$ is positive semi-definite and the optimization problem \eqref{Eq:approx_rec_opt} is convex. However, we can drop the nondecreasing requirement, and instead choose penalty functions concentrated outside the $m^{th}$ spectral band. Options we explore include (i) the polynomial filter $\varphi_m(\lambda)=1-\tilde{h}(\lambda)$; (ii) the rational filter $\varphi_m(\lambda)=\frac{1}{\tilde{h}(\lambda)+\epsilon}-\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}$; 
%{\color{red} Check nonnegativity}
and (iii) a polynomial approximation of a penalty function constructed as a piecewise cubic spline, an approach explored in \cite{chen_saad}. See Fig. \ref{Fig:penalty} for example graphs of these penalty functions.

\end{figure}

From the first-order optimality conditions, the solution to \eqref{Eq:approx_rec_opt} is the solution to the linear system of equations
\begin{align}\label{Eq:approx_rec_sol}
\Bigl(\kappa M_m^{\top}{\boldsymbol \Omega}_{m,\V_m}^{-1}M_m+\varphi_m(\L)\Bigr){\bf  z}=\kappa M_m^{\top}{\boldsymbol \Omega}_{m,\V_m}^{-1}{\bf y}_{\V_m},
\end{align}
which can be solved, for example, with the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. For the preconditioner, we use a diagonal matrix whose $i^{th}$ element is equal to 1 if $i \notin {\V_m}$ and $1+\frac{\kappa}{{\boldsymbol \omega}_m(i)}$ if $i \in {\V_m}$, which serves as an approximation to the matrix $\kappa M_m^{\top}{\boldsymbol \Omega}_{m,\V_m}^{-1}M_m+\varphi_m(\L)$ in \eqref{Eq:approx_rec_sol}.

%If $y_{\V_m}$ are the analysis coefficients of the $m^{th}$ branch, the standard least squares reconstruction is to solve $x_m^*=\argmin_{x \in \R^{k_m}} ||\mathbf{U}_{{\cal R}_m}x - y_{\V_m} ||_2$, and let $f_{m,{rec}}(\V_m)=y_{\V_m}$ and $f_{m,{rec}}(\V_m^c)=\mathbf{U}_{\V_m^c,{\cal R}_m}x_m^*$; however, this requires a full eigendcomposition of $\L$ to get $\mathbf{U}$. Our ongoing work includes developing an efficient optimization algorithm that directly uses a function of $\L$ rather than $\mathbf{U}$ to stably reconstruct signals supported on a specific spectral band from its samples.

%\subsection{Reconstruction robustness to noisy or thresholded filter bank coefficients} \label{Se:noisy_ext}
%For any partition into uniqueness sets, the proposed transform perfectly recovers the signal from the analysis coefficients. However, the choice of the downsampling patterns and interpolation method can dramatically affect the stability of the reconstruction if the analysis coefficients are corrupted by noise or are only partially available, or approximate filters are used to speed up the transform . Thus, we plan to investigate the role of the initial choice of the $\gamma_i$'s in Algorithm \ref{Al:uniqueness} in improving the stability of the reconstruction.



\subsection{Summary and properties of the fast M-CSFB transform} \label{Se:fast_prop}
In summary, the set up for the fast M-CSFB consists of designing the filter bank via Algorithm \ref{Al:filter_bank} and choosing the downsampling sets via Algorithm \ref{Al:downsampling}. To analyze a signal, we apply each of the $M$ Jackson-Chebyshev polynomial filters output from Algorithm \ref{Al:filter_bank} to the signal, and the downsample on the corresponding set of vertices output from Algorithm \ref{Al:downsampling}. To synthesize a signal from its transform coefficients, we solve \eqref{Eq:approx_rec_sol} for each band and sum the results. The complexity of the set up is dominated by the computation of $\{\bar{T}_k(\L){\bf X}\}_{k=0,1,\ldots,K}$  via \eqref{Eq:Tkbar_rec}, which has computational complexity ${\cal O}(JK|\E|)$. The computational complexity of the analysis is ${\cal O}(K|\E|)$. So, if $N$ is large, the number of random vectors $J$ and degree of polynomial approximation $K$ are small compared to $N$, and the graph is sparse ($|\E|$ is roughly a small constant times $N$), the setup and analysis scale linearly with the number of vertices. If each $\varphi_m$ is taken to be an order $K$ polynomial and the conjugate gradient is run for at most $I$ iterations, the bottleneck computation of the synthesis has complexity ${\cal O}(IMK|\E|)$. In practice, the required number of iterations and corresponding computation time depend on the conditioning of the matrix on the left-hand side of \eqref{Eq:approx_rec_sol} and the choice of preconditioner. %{\color{red} Check for faster methods.}

When the degree of approximation $K$ is small, the energy of the atoms of the fast, approximate transform, which are of the form $\tilde{h}_m(\L){\boldsymbol \delta}_i$, may be slightly more spread in the spectral domain than those of the form ${h}_m(\L){\boldsymbol \delta}_i$, due to the polynomial approximation of the ideal filter. However, the energy is also guaranteed to be supported completely within a radius of $K$ hops from the center vertex $i$ \cite{hammond2011wavelets,shuman2015vertex}. Thus, we have better control over the spread in the vertex domain, which, as we saw in the scale 3 wavelet atom in Fig. \ref{Fig:bunny_coef}, may be larger with the ideal filters.

%%\item The analysis and synthesis operations for the proposed scalable $M$-channel filter bank are summarized in Algorithms XXX and ZZZ, respectively.
%\item Joint vertex-frequency localization of the atoms
%%\item Computational complexity
%\end{itemize}



\section{Signal-Adapted Fast M-CSFB Transform} \label{Se:signal_adapted}
Just as it is helpful for interpolation to sample more signal values at vertices where the energy of the selected eigenvectors is concentrated, it is also helpful to sample more values where the energy of the filtered signals is concentrated. Thus, in this section, we make three adaptations to the fast M-CSFB transform. 

First, we subtract the mean of the signal (i.e., let ${\bf f}={\bf f}-\frac{{\bf 1}^{\top}{\bf f}}{N} {\bf 1}$) before sending it into the filter bank, and then add this constant back to every vertex when summing the interpolations from the $M$ channels. To ensure critical sampling, we only allow $N-1$ total samples in addition to this mean measurement. Second, we adapt the sampling weights by setting ${\boldsymbol \omega}_m(i) = {\boldsymbol \omega}_m(i) \cdot  \log\left(1+|(\tilde{h}_m(\L){\bf f})(i)|\right)$. Thus, if a filtered signal on a given band is concentrated on a certain region of the graph, the sampling weights will be concentrated on the intersection of that region of the graph and the set of vertices where the energy of the selected eigenvectors is concentrated. Because we have subtracted out the mean of the signal in the preprocessing step, $\sum_{i=1}^N (\tilde{h}_m(\L){\bf f})(i)=0$ for all $m$, and thus, the multiplicative weight adjustment does not introduce any bias.

Third, beyond the distribution of samples within each band, we need to decide how many samples to allocate to each band. In the exact computation (small graph) case, allocating the samples according to the number of eigenvalues contained in the disjoint bands ensures perfect reconstruction. However, with approximate computations, it is beneficial to the overall reconstruction error to do a better job of interpolation on the bands whose filtered signals have the most energy. Based on numerical experiments, we set the initial number of samples by multiplying the estimate of the number of eigenvalues in the band with $\log(1+||\tilde{h}_m(\L){\bf f}||)$, as shown in Algorithm \ref{Al:downsampling}. In the extreme case of a filtered signal with no energy, this choice leads to zero measurements and a reconstruction of the all zero vector.

Note that when analyzing a single signal, these adaptations do not add significantly to the computational complexity of the transform. However, if we are repeating the transform on many different signals residing on the same graph, we do need to rerun the random selection of vertices for each signal.





\section{Illustrative Examples II: Approximate Calculations} \label{Se:ill2}

First, in Fig. \ref{Fig:samp_tradeoff}, we explore the tradeoff between the number of samples and the reconstruction error.  Here, we take $K=J=50$, $\gamma=1$, the tolerance for the relative residual in the preconditioned conjugate gradient to be $10^{-10}$, and $\{\varphi_m\}$ to be the spline-based penalty filters.  Note that the polynomial approximated filters have wider supports as compared to the ideal filters. By performing critical sampling based on the estimated supports of the ideal filters, we may not have enough samples to reconstruct signals from the (wider) filtered subspace. %miss some parts of the spectrum on which the polynomial filters are supported. 
In order to get a better reconstruction, we can include more samples for each band. The second and third rows up from the bottom in Fig. \ref{Fig:samp_tradeoff} show the absolute values of the reconstruction errors, averaged over 50 trials of the random sampling, when the number of random samples is equal to the estimated number of eigenvalues in the specified band (173 in the lowpass case and 445 in the bandpass case). The last row demonstrates how the 
reconstruction errors, expressed in normalized mean square error (NMSE), decrease as we increase the number of samples for each band, up to three times the estimated number of eigenvalues. We also see the effect of adapting the non-uniform sampling distributions to the filtered signal, as discussed in Section \ref{Se:signal_adapted}. %, we get smaller reconstruction errors.

Next, we examine average temperatures for March 2018, taken from the Gridded 5km GHCN-Daily Temperature and Precipitation Dataset (nClimGrid) \cite{nClimGrid1,nClimGrid2} of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The measurements are taken on a grid with spacing of $\frac{1}{24}$ of a degree for both latitude and longitude. We form an unweighted graph by connecting each measurement location to its eight neighbors on the grid, if they contain measurements, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(a)-(b). We then eliminate isolated vertices and small components (e.g., islands) to yield a connected graph with 469,404 vertices (measurement locations). Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(c)-(e) show an estimate of the cumulative spectral distribution function of the graph, the resulting approximate filter bank with five bands and degree 50 polynomial approximations, and the temperature measurements. 

Because of the fairly regular structure of this graph, the non-uniform sampling distributions look similar for each band when not adapted to the signal. An intuitive explanation of the distribution for the second band, which is shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(g), is that we want to sample with higher probability near the edges, as there are fewer neighbors from whom to interpolate the local average value. The 27,021 vertices selected for $\V_2$, shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(i), are spread across the graph, with a higher density near the boundaries. The corresponding non-uniform sampling distribution and realization for the second band in the signal-adapted case are shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(h) and Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(j). The non-zero analysis coefficients of the bandpass filters tend to coincide with topographical changes, as shown Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(f). Accordingly, the signal-adapted transform selects more samples from these regions.

%There are more samples where the energy of the filtered signal in Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(f) is concentrated, in the regions featuring more topographical changes. 
Two scaling functions for the fast M-CSFB are shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(k)-(l), with the image for the latter one zoomed in near the Great Salt Lake. Because $K=50$, the atoms are localized within 50 hops of the center vertex. When the center is in a region of dense measurements (each vertex has 8 neighbors), the atoms are symmetric, resembling the scaling functions of 2D-wavelets. When the center is near an edge, like the one shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(l), the atom adapts to the shape of the underlying graph. While adapting the transform to the signal changes the distribution of center locations, it does not change the shape of the atoms; that is, if a vertex $i$ is chosen as a center location for a given scale in both the non-adapted and signal-adapted versions of the transform, the corresponding atoms are identical. 

The magnitudes of the analysis coefficients, shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(m)-(n), decay quickly, which is not surprising as the signal is generally smooth with some discontinuities that tend to coincide with topographical changes. Also note that the signal-adapted transform allocates more samples to the bands on the lower end of the spectrum (57,539 total for the first two bands, as opposed to 43,384 in the non-adapted case).

%{\color{blue} 
Fig. \ref{Fig:temperature}(o)-(p) shows the reconstruction errors for the two versions of the fast $M$-CSFB transform, with the same parameters listed at the beginning of this section, except $J=30$. The mean square error of the signal-adapted transform is 0.0479, as opposed to 0.4994 without the signal adaptation. The first driver of this reduction is the allocation of additional samples to the first band, where 0.4586 of the 0.4994 mean square error is incurred when not adapted to the signal. Additionally, more of the samples for this band are taken in the upper and lower thirds of the country, where the energy of the filtered signal is concentrated. % Regular: MSE: 0.4994, NMSE:
  % 2.4987e-08; Adapted: MSE: .0479, NMSE: 2.3982e-09. Main driver of improvement is having more samples in the first band}

%The first column of Fig. \ref{Fig:temp_reconstruction} shows an example atom at each band. If vertex $i \in \V_m$, then $\tilde{h}_m(\L){\boldsymbol \delta}_i$ is an atom that is localized within $K=80$ hops of node $i$ in the vertex domain. Its energy is also localized to the support of $\tilde{h}_m(\cdot)$ in the graph spectral domain. This joint vertex-frequency localization is a key property for wavelet-like transforms. }

In Table \ref{Ta:comp_times}, we compare the computation times of the proposed transform to that of the exact graph Fourier transform (i.e., a full diagonalization of $\L$), for five different graphs. The community graph has 100 communities. We display the analysis and synthesis times in seconds.
%, as well as the NMSE for each graph and each method. 
For both the original fast $M$-CSFB and the signal adapted version, we consider two scenarios. Scenario A is faster, but less accurate, with $K=25$, a conjugate gradient (CG) tolerance of 1e-8, and a maximum of 100 CG iterations. For Scenario B, we take $K=50$, the CG tolerance to be 1e-10, and a maximum of 250 iterations. For all cases, we let $J=30$ and $\gamma=1$, and subtract out the mean of the signal before applying the filter bank. For larger graphs, the full diagonalization is not possible due to memory limits. We use the signals shown above for the sensor network, bunny graph, and temperature network, and random noise vectors for the other two graphs.

\section{Conclusion and Extension}
\label{Sec:ongoing}
%{\color{blue} %Eliminate once we've covered all of these issues elsewhere.}
We have proposed a fast, critically sampled transform that approximately projects a graph signal onto different bands of the graph Laplacian spectrum. To improve computational efficiency, we leveraged the computation of $\{\bar{T}_k(\L){\bf X}\}$ in multiple ways: to estimate the spectral density for the design of the filter bank, to estimate the number of samples for each band, and to estimate the non-uniform sampling distribution. The key idea behind the filter bank design is to choose the end points of each band to be in less dense regions of the spectrum so that the resulting filters are more amenable to polynomial approximation. Adapting the non-uniform sampling distribution and allocation of the samples across the bands to the specific signal being analyzed improves the speed and accuracy of the synthesis process without adding to the computational complexity of the setup and analysis steps. 

If the graph Laplacian eigenvalues are distinct, using the exact M-CSFB transform of Section \ref{Se:fb_design} with $M=N$ and the filter endpoints $\tau_0=0$, $\tau_M = \lambda_{\max}+1$, and $\tau_m=\frac{\lambda_{m-1}+\lambda_m}{2}$ for $m=1,2,\ldots,N-1$ yields exactly the graph Fourier transform. Thus, the proposed transform can be seen as a fast version of the graph Fourier transform with a coarser resolution in the spectral domain. This resolution is controlled by the number of spectral bands; as we add more bands for finer resolution in the spectral domain, we need higher degree polynomials to accurately approximate the filters, which in turn slows down the computations and may result in atoms whose energy is more spread in the vertex domain. We have seen that for a reasonably small number of bands compared to the number of vertices $N$, a low degree polynomial approximation suffices and the atoms are jointly localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. 

On the other hand, the atoms of the proposed transform can also be viewed as a subset of the atoms of a spectral graph wavelet transform  \cite{hammond2011wavelets}, albeit with a different set of filters. Both transforms yield atoms of the form $\tilde{h}_m(\L){\boldsymbol \delta}_i$, but the spectral graph wavelet transform includes every vertex $i$ as a center vertex for every scale $m$. 
%{\color{red} Only other critically sampled filter bank to be this fast is diffusion wavelets? Compare here.}

%\subsection{Iterated filter bank} 
As with the classical wavelet construction, it is possible to iterate the filter bank on the output from the lowpass channel.
This could be beneficial, for example, in the case that we want to visualize the graph signal at different resolutions on  a sequence of coarser and coarser graphs. An interesting question for future work is how iterating the filter bank with fewer channels at each step compares to a single filter bank with more channels and each filter supported on a smaller region of the spectrum.
